                <p class="hero-about">
                    Hi, I’m Katrina Ashman. I’ve always been fascinated by how machines can learn, adapt, and interact
                    with the world. My journey into software started early in a Montessori classroom, where curiosity
                    ruled and I wrote my first Java program to create an animated demo for my class. Watching code turn
                    into something alive hooked me instantly.

                    That curiosity followed me through high school, where I built puzzle-driven websites to turn
                    studying into a game and explored projects that blended creativity with logic. One of the most
                    formative experiences was working with eye-tracking and machine learning, which sparked a deeper
                    interest in artificial intelligence and robotics.

                    I’m driven by problem-solving, curiosity, and the challenge of building systems that learn and
                    respond in meaningful ways. I’m especially excited by technology that pushes the boundaries of how
                    machines understand the world — and how we can shape what they become.

                         Welcome to my page!  My name is Katrina Ashman, and I am a 3rd year CS undergrad at the University of Virginia.
                        I got my start in software engineering while working on a machine learning image detection project while in high school.
                          My interest lay with using technology and artificial intelligence to boost creativity and to protect our planet and those who live on it.

                    <p>
                        Welcome to my page! My name is Katrina Ashman, and I am a software engineering undergraduate
                        student from Richmond, Virginia. My interest in software began in high school while working on a
                        machine learning image detection project, which introduced me to the possibilities of artificial
                        intelligence.

                        I am passionate about using technology to combine creativity with problem-solving and am
                        especially interested in how artificial intelligence can support innovation, enhance learning,
                        and help protect our planet and its ecosystems.

                        I am driven by curiosity and enjoy building projects that challenge me to think creatively while
                        making a meaningful impact.

                    <p>
                        Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, going on bike rides, exploring nature, and participating in
                        creative means whether through drawing, 3 dimensional, or putting together short animations.
