                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    It was my first year at the University of Virginia, and I had been looking forward to
                    getting to meet more people from the computer science department. That was when I came
                    accross a flyer that stated that read "HUMAN" across the front. I decided to look further into
                    what the project was about. That was how I learned that Panagiotis Apostolellis from the CS
                    department
                    was looking for students to help researchs ways that we could use technology to bring people
                    together.
                    This seemed like the perfect opportunity not only to get involved in research, but to also use
                    technology
                    in a way to directly apply it to my own situation in a new environment.
                </p>

                <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>SCRUM methodology</li>
                    <li>Project planning</li>
                    <li>Trello boards</li>
                    <li>Figma designing</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Our first meeting invitation came out near the end of September. I don’t believe any of us knew for
                    sure what we had signed up for. I packed my gray backpack with my laptop, notebooks, pencils, and
                    waterbottle, and waited at Rice Hall for our ride to come. Shortly after my arrival, a girl in a
                    black Honda pulled up to the side of the building, and I timidly asked as a freshman might before
                    heading into a random vehicle for a completely ambiguous event whether she was the driver for
                    Project HUMAN.

                    <figure class="float-image">
                        <img src="/images/Projects/Human/owl.jpeg" alt="Descriptive alt text">

                    <p>
                        After about 20 minutes in the car, we pulled up to a grassy area with makeshift soccer goals,
                        and a large picnic blanket with Greek pastries sprawled across. The professor came over and
                        introduced himself. In total, there were about 10 other students ranging from first years like
                        myself to grad students who were there to learn more about this mystery project.
                        <br><br>We started off the session with some team building exercises where we had to work in
                        groups of 2 or 3 to act out scenarios, tell each other stories, and compete in games such as
                        soccer. It was an untraditional but rewarding experience.

                    <p>
                        At the end of the semester, the professor invited all of the participants to stay over at a
                        retreat on a lake to discuss our takeaways from the past few months. One the first day, he led
                        us down a dirt path to a room carved into the side of a hill. This was a tech-free day where we
                        were left to journal and illustrate our own belief of our values, individual stories, and what
                        made us who we are.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    Back at the retreat, the professor prompted each of us to come up with our own design for a type of
                    technology that would help to build the same kind of connection for others that our experiences over
                    the course of the project had done for us. This led to the design of an artifact that would later be
                    known as Anthropo, a plush animal with a microphone embedded in one eye which allows for those
                    holding it to record themselves talking about their day, stories, and experiences. The artifact
                    could then be mailed to different people from around the world allowing their stories to spread
                    without the necessity for digital devices.
