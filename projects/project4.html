            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In November 2022, three classmates and I were selected for a three-month remote internship with Mozilla
                Firefox. During this internship, our team was tasked with designing pop-up modals for the browser’s new
                interface to help introduce first-time users to Firefox’s features and navigation tools.</p>
            <h2>Agile Development and Team Workflow</h2>
            <p>The internship followed the SCRUM methodology, allowing our team to work in structured development
                sprints. Each week, we received project tasks, delegated responsibilities among team members, and
                presented progress updates to our project manager during weekly SCRUM meetings. We organized and tracked
                our workflow using Trello, which allowed us to manage tasks efficiently through clearly defined “To Do,”
                “In Progress,” and “Completed” stages.</p>

            <h2>Resources Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Trello – Weekly planning and team notes</li>
                <li>Miro – Outline, initial team planning (week 1)</li>
                <li>Figma – Prototype</li>
                <li>Canva – Designs</li>
                <li>Statscounter Global Stats – Comparative data source #1</li>
                <li>Statistica – Comparative data source #2</li>
                <li>Oberlo – Comparative data source #3</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>User Research and Data Collection</h2>
            <p>During the first week, our team designed and distributed a survey targeting Firefox users to better
                understand what initially attracted them to the browser. By the end of the week, we collected and
                analyzed sufficient data to inform our design and messaging strategy moving forward.</p>
            <h2>Message and Modal Design</h2>
            <figure class="float-image-icn">
                <img src="../images/Projects/Mozilla/GoGoMozilla.png" alt="Descriptive alt text">
                <figcaption>"GoGo Mozilla", an early modal design</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In Sprint Two, we focused on developing messaging concepts for the modals. We collaborated in person to
                brainstorm key themes and user-focused messaging that highlighted Firefox’s benefits. After presenting
                our ideas to the project manager and incorporating their feedback, we transitioned into the design
                phase. Using Canva, we created modal prototypes tailored to the browser interface, including multiple
                design variations optimized for both light and dark modes. These concepts were compiled into a
                comprehensive design sheet for review.</p>

                    <figcaption>Additional variants of modal designs</figcaption>
                </figure>
            <h2>Team Collaboration</h2>
            <p>Throughout the internship, we also completed peer evaluations to promote accountability and effective
                collaboration. During this process, we encountered a participation challenge involving a team member who
                became less engaged after the first sprint. To address this, I initiated an informal one-on-one
                conversation to better understand their concerns and identify ways to support their involvement. Through
                this discussion, I learned they had strong graphic design experience but felt hesitant presenting in
                group settings. I offered to support them during presentations and encouraged the team to actively
                recognize and respect their contributions, which helped improve collaboration and overall team dynamics.
            </p>
            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
            <p>During Sprint Three, we developed functional prototypes of our modal designs using JavaScript Object
                Notation (JSON) to test scaling, placement, and browser compatibility. We documented these results and
                presented them to the project manager for review before the concepts were shared with Mozilla’s
                marketing team for further evaluation.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This internship strengthened my experience working in agile development environments, conducting
                user-focused research, and collaborating across design and technical disciplines. It also reinforced my
                interest in creating technology that improves user accessibility and engagement through thoughtful
                interface design.</p>
