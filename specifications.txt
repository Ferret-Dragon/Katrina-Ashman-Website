Based on the https://www.jeyausten.com/ website

In the nav bar include: Projects, Resume, Get in Touch

Homepage has my name large on the left (main font)
Under my name in smaller text is my about me

Next part of the page is a pannel with the three most recents of my work (using image placeholder and loren ipsum description for now) with a read more under each pannel that locates to a full page where i can put more information about that project
Under 3 most recent projects, inclde a see more button to lead to a page with short description boxes to click to read more about each of my projects

Have a Who is Me? Pannel with a placeholder for a picture of me on the left of the description, and a get in touch button that leads to my contact page

At the end, include a blog sort of thing where I can put articles about myself

A contact section with my name, email, school email, phone number, address

Follow along at the bottom of the page where you can click to get my linkedIn and GitHub



Details:
Edges are not rounded.
Images have a 3px border.
Colors: 700000, 0F4210, #666, and similar shades that work well (although make it easy for me to change later)
either Urbanist font or something strong and fancy, and times new roman (although make it easy for me to change later)
Favor a black background with white text
I want the website to be clean and easy to modify
